## What it does

Polymarket runs short-window crypto prediction markets: every 5 or 15 minutes a new "Up or Down?" market opens for BTC, ETH, SOL, or XRP. You bet on whether the price will be higher or lower than the opening price when the window closes.

This terminal app lets you:

- Watch the **live spot price** (Chainlink) vs each window's **Price to Beat**
- See the full **UP / DOWN order book** in real time
- Place **market orders** (FAK — Fill or Kill) and **limit orders** (GTD — expire just before window close) with single keypresses
- Track your **open positions and unrealized PnL**
- Use an optional **trailing stop** — tracks **best bid**, arms after a gross move (`MARKET_BUY_TAKE_PROFIT_BPS`), then FAK-sells when the trail trips; works for **market (FAK) and limit (GTD) buys** (resting fills arm via the user-channel when you are **maker** on the trade)
- View **sentiment** (CLOB mid-price or top holders from Data API)
- **Redeem** resolved winnings via the Polymarket relayer (Safe wallets)
- Fetch a **Solana USDC deposit address** via Polymarket Bridge (key `f`)

Everything happens in the terminal. No browser required once you have your wallet configured.

## Quick start

### Option A — pre-built binary (no Rust required)

1. **Download** the binary for your platform from the [Releases page](../../releases/latest):

   | Platform | File |
   |---|---|
   | Linux x86-64 | `polymarket-crypto-linux-x86_64` |
   | macOS Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) | `polymarket-crypto-macos-aarch64` |
   | Windows x86-64 | `polymarket-crypto-windows-x86_64.exe` |

   Also grab **`.env.example`** from the repository root — it is not bundled in the release. Download it from the repo's file list on GitHub.

2. **Create your `.env`** from the example:

   **Linux / macOS**
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   **Windows (cmd)**
   ```cmd
   copy .env.example .env
   ```
   **Windows (PowerShell)**
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Edit `.env`** — fill in at minimum `POLYMARKET_PK`, `POLYMARKET_FUNDER`, and `POLYGON_RPC_URL` (see [Configure `.env`](#configure-env) below).

4. **Run**:

   **Linux**
   ```sh
   chmod +x polymarket-crypto-linux-x86_64
   ./polymarket-crypto-linux-x86_64
   ```

   **macOS** (Apple Silicon only — M1/M2/M3)
   ```sh
   chmod +x polymarket-crypto-macos-aarch64
   # Remove the quarantine flag set by the browser download
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./polymarket-crypto-macos-aarch64
   ./polymarket-crypto-macos-aarch64
   ```
   If macOS still blocks launch, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway** next to the blocked binary.

   **Windows**
   ```powershell
   # Run from the same directory as your .env file
   .\polymarket-crypto-windows-x86_64.exe
   ```
   If Windows Defender SmartScreen blocks the binary, click **More info → Run anyway**.

### Option B — build from source

#### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.80+** — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
- A **funded Polymarket wallet**. The typical setup is an EOA (private key) that controls a Gnosis Safe holding your USDC. Both addresses go in `.env`.
- The Safe must have approved the CTF Exchange and NegRisk Exchange as spenders. If you've ever placed a trade through the Polymarket web UI, this is already done.
- A **Polygon RPC endpoint** (Alchemy, drpc, or the free `polygon-rpc.com`) for on-chain balance reads.

#### Build

```sh
git clone <this-repo>
cd polymarket-crypto
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — see configuration section below
cargo build --release
```

### Configure `.env`

The only required fields to start:

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `POLYMARKET_PK` | Private key of the EOA that signs orders (starts with `0x`) |
| `POLYMARKET_FUNDER` | Address that holds your USDC — your Gnosis Safe address for most users |
| `POLYMARKET_SIG_TYPE` | `2` Gnosis Safe (default), `0` plain EOA, `3` deposit wallet ([`POLY_1271`](https://docs.polymarket.com/trading/deposit-wallet-migration)) |
| `POLYGON_RPC_URL` | Polygon HTTPS endpoint for balance reads |
| `DEFAULT_SIZE_USDC` | Default order size in USDC (e.g. `5.0`) |
| `DEFAULT_PRICE` | Default limit price for `[`/`]` quick-limit keys and the `l` modal pre-fill (0.01–0.99, default `0.50`) |

Optional but useful:

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `POLYMARKET_PROXY` | Proxy for geo-blocked regions — see [Geo-restrictions](#geo-restricted) |
| `MARKET_BUY_TRAIL_BPS` | Trailing stop width in bps from peak bid (`0` = off). Applies to **market and limit BUY** when set |
| `MARKET_BUY_TAKE_PROFIT_BPS` | **Activation**: trail arms when `best_bid ≥ entry × (1 + bps/10_000)` (`0` ≈ arm as soon as bid reaches entry). Also used for auto take-profit **GTD sell after market BUY** when `TRAIL_BPS` is `0` |
| `MARKET_BUY_SLIPPAGE_BPS` | Slippage cushion for market buys. Default `50` (0.5%) |
| `POLYMARKET_RELAYER_API_KEY` | Redeem (`x` / `X`, Safe only), **`deploy-wallet`**, and deposit-wallet **approvals** (`b` in TUI when `SIG_TYPE=3`) — same Relayer API key from Settings → API |

### Deposit wallet (`POLYMARKET_SIG_TYPE=3`)

Polymarket’s **[deposit wallet](https://docs.polymarket.com/trading/deposit-wallet-migration)** flow uses on-chain **`POLY_1271`** signatures and a deterministic proxy address derived from your EOA.

1. Deploy `WALLET-CREATE` once: **`polymarket-crypto deploy-wallet`**. Needs **`POLYMARKET_RELAYER_API_KEY`** + **`POLYMARKET_RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS`** (same as CTF redeem). **`RELAYER_URL`** defaults to production; set it for preprod.

   ```sh
   polymarket-crypto deploy-wallet
   ```

   Then set **`POLYMARKET_FUNDER`** to the printed deposit wallet address (the bot checks it matches the deterministic address in [`src/deposit_wallet.rs`](src/deposit_wallet.rs) for your `POLYMARKET_PK`).

2. **Approvals** — in the TUI, press **`b`** to submit a relayer **`WALLET`** batch: pUSD `approve` + CTF `setApprovalForAll` for CTF Exchange V2 and Neg-risk Exchange V2 (same relayer API key as `deploy-wallet` / redeem). Then call CLOB balance sync as in the [migration guide](https://docs.polymarket.com/trading/deposit-wallet-migration) (the app refreshes collateral + current market conditional allowances after a successful batch).
3. Fund **pUSD** to the deposit wallet; EOA balance does not count as CLOB buying power for this mode.
4. `x` / **CTF redeem** in this app still targets **Gnosis Safe** (`POLYMARKET_SIG_TYPE=2`) only; deposit-wallet redeem needs `WALLET` batches (not implemented here).

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list and descriptions.

#### Run (after build from source)

```sh
./target/release/polymarket-crypto
```

On launch, a wizard appears:

1. **Pick an asset** — BTC, ETH, SOL, or XRP (↑/↓ or `j`/`k`, then Enter)
2. **Pick a timeframe** — 5m or 15m (↑/↓ or `j`/`k`, then Enter)

You'll then land on the trading screen. Press **`q`** or **Ctrl-C** to exit; **`Esc`** goes back to the timeframe picker.

## Key bindings

### Trading screen

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `w` / `s` | Market **BUY** UP / DOWN (FAK at best ask) |
| `a` / `d` | Market **SELL** UP / DOWN (FAK at best bid) |
| `l` | Open limit-order modal (pre-fills default price) |
| `[` | Quick limit **BUY UP** GTD — default size & price |
| `]` | Quick limit **BUY DOWN** GTD — default size & price |
| `c` | Cancel ALL open orders |
| `x` / `X` | Redeem all resolved positions (requires relayer key) |
| `e` | Edit default ticket size |
| `p` | Edit default limit price |
| `f` | Fetch Solana USDC deposit address + QR code |
| `r` | Force-refresh active market |
| `Esc` | Return to timeframe picker |
| `q` / Ctrl-C | Quit |

Holding a key down does **not** fire repeated orders — key repeat is ignored.

### Default size and price

The status bar shows two editable defaults used by quick-trade keys and as pre-filled values when opening the limit modal:

- **`e`** — edit **size** (USDC budget, shown in yellow)
- **`p`** — edit **price** (limit price 0.01–0.99, shown in cyan; default `0.50`)

Type digits and `.`, then `Enter` or `Esc` to confirm. Invalid input reverts to the previous value.

### Limit-order modal (`l`)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `w` / `s` / `a` / `d` | Set outcome + side (UP/DOWN, BUY/SELL) |
| ← / → | Flip outcome (UP ↔ DOWN) |
| ↑ / ↓ | Flip side (BUY ↔ SELL) |
| `Tab` | Switch between price and size fields |
| digits / `.` | Edit current field |
| `Enter` | Submit GTD limit order |
| `Esc` | Close modal |

GTD orders expire one second before the active window closes. The app enforces a minimum of 5 shares on submit to avoid `INVALID_ORDER_MIN_SIZE` from the CLOB API.

### Order sizing

- **Market BUY** (`w`/`s`) — size is a **USDC budget** (Polymarket FAK = dollar amount to spend)
- **Market SELL** (`a`/`d`) — size is **outcome shares**
- **Limit BUY** — type the notional in USDC; the app converts to shares before submitting
- **Limit SELL** — type shares directly

## Safety tips

1. Start with a small `DEFAULT_SIZE_USDC` (e.g. `1.0` or `5.0`) until you trust the setup.
2. Run `debug-auth` before your first trade to verify credentials are correct (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-clob-credentials)).
3. If you enable `MARKET_BUY_TRAIL_BPS`, a trip fires a real **FAK SELL** (market or limit buy). Test with minimum size first. For **resting limit buys**, the trail is registered when the fill hits the user WebSocket as a **maker** leg; an immediate limit match in the POST response uses the same path as a market buy.
4. Never commit `.env` with real keys. The example ships with zero-filled keys so a copy without editing will fail loudly.

## Geo-restricted?

Polymarket blocks a broad set of IPs. If the spot price, order book, and Gamma data are all missing, you're likely blocked. Set `POLYMARKET_PROXY` in `.env`:

```
POLYMARKET_PROXY=http://user:pass@proxy.example.com:8080   # HTTP/HTTPS
POLYMARKET_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080                   # SOCKS5
```

All traffic — REST, WebSockets, Chainlink feed — tunnels through the proxy. TLS is end-to-end so the proxy only sees ciphertext. A residential or datacenter proxy in any non-blocked region works.

## Troubleshooting CLOB credentials

If the status line shows auth errors, run the diagnostic command (skip the TUI entirely):

```sh
# source build
./target/release/polymarket-crypto debug-auth
# pre-built binary — use the name for your platform:
./polymarket-crypto-linux-x86_64 debug-auth        # Linux
./polymarket-crypto-macos-aarch64 debug-auth        # macOS
.\polymarket-crypto-windows-x86_64.exe debug-auth  # Windows
```

It prints every intermediate signing value (typeHash, domainSeparator, digest, signature) and the exact HTTP status + body from Polymarket's auth endpoints.

Common failures:

| `debug-auth` output | Cause |
|---|---|
| `401` — mentions *signature* or *address* | `POLYMARKET_PK` doesn't match the wallet Polymarket expects |
| `401` — mentions *timestamp* | Clock skew > ~10 s. Run `sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org` |
| `403 Forbidden` | Proxy region still blocked, or wallet tripped compliance |
| `404 Not Found` on derive, `200` on create | No existing API key — now created, will work on next launch |
| Warning: funder equals signer | Wrong `POLYMARKET_SIG_TYPE`. Use `0` for plain EOA, `2` for Safe |

**Wallet never used on polymarket.com?** Log in once, deposit a small amount, then re-run `debug-auth`. The backend needs a record of the wallet before it will issue API keys.

Every run also writes a full debug log to `./polymarket-crypto.log` (override with `POLYMARKET_CRYPTO_LOG_PATH`). `tail -f polymarket-crypto.log` in a second pane is useful while the TUI runs.

## Architecture overview

The app is event-driven: all producers send `AppEvent` messages over a bounded `mpsc` channel (512 slots). The main loop drains events in batches, updates `AppState`, and calls `ratatui::draw`. Redraws are throttled to ~20 Hz during feed-heavy bursts so the app doesn't pin a CPU core.

```
Keyboard / resize ──┐
1 Hz ticker ────────┤
Chainlink RTDS WS ──┤──▶  mpsc<AppEvent>  ──▶  AppState  ──▶  ratatui draw
CLOB book WS ───────┤
CLOB user WS ───────┤
Gamma poll (15s/1s) ┘
```

Network I/O never runs on the render path. Trading actions (place order, cancel, redeem, bridge) dispatch onto separate `tokio` tasks. Orders are signed with EIP-712 using `alloy` + `alloy-sol-types` and the on-chain `Order` shape from the CTF Exchange.

## Known limitations

- **Trailing + resting limits.** If a limit buy that first went `live` later fills with you as **taker** on the user-channel trade, the app may not register that fill for trailing (maker-leg path only). Prefer a market buy or an immediately matched limit if you rely on the trail.
- **Trailing after restart.** With `MARKET_BUY_TRAIL_BPS > 0` (stored at market roll), trade replay re-registers a trail from **long size + VWAP `avg_entry`**; the in-trail peak ratchet starts over from the new session’s book (no remembered pre-crash peak).
- **No full web-app parity.** Edge cases like partial fills or unusual order states may not match what the website shows.
- **No on-chain allowance setup.** Assumes spender approvals are already set. If not, run a one-time approval script (see [NautilusTrader docs](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/polymarket/) for reference).
- **Relayer required for redemption.** The `x` key only works with `POLYMARKET_RELAYER_API_KEY` and `POLYMARKET_SIG_TYPE=2`. Plain EOA users need the web Portfolio page.
- **In-memory fill history.** PnL and fills reset on restart. Swap the `VecDeque<Fill>` for SQLite if you need persistence.
- **5m and 15m only in the wizard.** Daily markets are supported in the discovery code but not exposed in the UI.
